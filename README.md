## Assignment Description Transcript in 🇬🇧

Consider the negative feedback system of the figure below with

$G(s)=\frac{s+2}{s+4}$ and $G(s)=\frac{1}{s+2}$

(a) Using an m-file determine the closed-loop transfer function

(b) Produce the pole-zero diagram. Where are the poles and zeros of the closed loop system?

(c) Are there any mutually exclusive poles and zeros? If yes then use using matlab functions remove common poles and zeros in closed loop transfer function.

(d) Plot on the same diagram the step response of the system for S.M. before and after elimination of poles and zeros. What do you notice changes after this elimination? Why do you think it is important?
